# Tree Height (Asynchronous)

## Overview

The goal of this exercise is to test your understanding of a simple tree
data structure and methods for traversing and analyzing trees.
To make the problem a little more challenging, the provided `TreeNode`
implementation provides only an asynchronous function for fetching
children of a `TreeNode`. The `getChildrenAsync()` of `TreeNode` returns
a promise that is resolved after a random time period.

## Instructions

This exercise will require you to implement the following functions:

- `src/loadTree.js`: This function is used convert parsed data from a JSON
  file into a tree. The returned tree should be the root `TreeNode` of
  the given tree.

- `src/findTreeLongestPathsAsync.js`: This function is used to find
  the paths of the longest length for a tree. The function should return an
  array of paths with each path starting from the root `TreeNode` and
  ending at the leaf `TreeNode`. NOTE: It is possible for a tree to
  have multiple paths of the same length.

- `test/findTreeLongestPathsAsync.test.js`: Implement the stub test cases
  and add more to verify the functionality of methods that you implemented.

If you find any errors in the provided code then please fix these errors
and add test cases to help us understand the change. If the instructions
are not clear then feel free to make some assumptions but provide
documentation on why you made these assumptions.

## Bonus Points
While optimizing the solution is not the main focus, please feel free to identify any anti-patterns observed or optimizations needed. 

Feel free to call out, or preferrably change, any packages, coding styles, or naming conventions changed.

If this were an application you were using for a project make the changes that would improve it and document any changes here in the readme file under the "Changes Section"

## Changes
